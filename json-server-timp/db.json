Henson Johnson’s Crook preserve in order to execute a dome climb to promising leads located high in the back wall in the main entrance. There are a total of 3 possible leads in this area of the cave. Two appear to be entrances into developed canyon passage located approximately 65ft up the face of the wall. The third lead is located in the ceiling of this room, approximately another 40ft above the two aforementioned leads.  Upon arrival, we determined that the far right lead, which appeared to have an entrance to a well developed canyon passage, would be our first priority which provided the cleanest route up the wall to access. With Elliot belaying me, I set out to climb the wall, making 14 placements with removable gear, and reached the lead in just under two hours. The canyon passage went on for approximately 15ft, coming to a constriction between flowstone. Another 15ft of passage was gained after passing through the constriction before the passage terminated. The entrance to this lead will be the site for the new belay station from which the final climb to the lead in the ceiling will be accomplished. As such, we set rigging from the first lead, using 3/8 inch x 3” long ss bolts, with two rebelays in order to avoid large, loose boulders and sharp rocks, back to the main passage floor. Once the rigging was in place, the route was cleaned of all removable gear.\n\nFuture objectives\n\nWe will return to the cave to complete the final climb to the lead in the ceiling. After evaluating its potential for continuing passage, we will then rappel from this lead to the final third lead, located parallel to the first lead, offset approximately 20ft to the left. In the event that no significant passage is found, hangers will be removed from the rebelays set and bolts pounded through and covered.\n",

      "reportText": "Little Brush Creek Cave, Uintah County, Utah\nOn trip: Hannah Lieffring, Jason Weyland, Andy Armstrong, Eric Richards, Justin Calder\nAfter having done a lot of traveling and finally heading back to Utah, Hannah and I were thinking of our\ngood friends Andy and Bonny Armstrong. We reached out to them to see if they would be free for any\ncaving while we would be in Utah, and we were able to set up a trip to Little Brush Creek Cave which he\nstates being his favorite cave in Utah. Unfortunately Bonny wasn’t able to come along. But by the time\nthe trip rolled around, Eric Richards and Justin Calder were on board.\nAfter talking with Andy, we made a plan that we wanted to visit the black stream in the cave. Hannah\nand I made a trip there last November, and were stopped by towering mud banks that blocked the\npassage. Now, more prepared for what we would encounter, we were finally getting back there.\nWe drove out on Saturday morning to do nearby Toothbrush cave with Eric and Justin, as Andy couldn’t\narrive until Sunday, and checked a few leads that were given to us by Dave Herron. These caves have the\npotential to flood dramatically every summer, making the caves very dynamic by opening or closing\npassages. We were to check to see if any of those had opened in the many years since they were last\nchecked. We scouted some potential high leads that would later need bolt climbs done, and checked\nsome known dig leads that were mapped years ago to see if they had opened up. The big room where\nthe high leads were was really impressive with wintry ice stalagmites and a massive column of ice that\nmimicked flowstone. Eric and Justin took up the dig leads, while Hannah and I traveled back to the\nhigher parts of the cave to check some on some leads on the map. While there, we encountered\nnumerous amazing ice crystals that weren’t unlike gypsum flowers in shape. Both parties being\nunsuccessful and chilled to the core with the below freezing cave temps, we all went back to the main\nroom and started our climb out of the forty foot drop just inside the cave. After derigging and\nsnowshoeing back to the car, we discovered that we had parked a little to far in the snow and had\ngotten stuck. In order to get out, we had to get a little creative with some webbing, an old rope and\nJustin’s new Tacoma. About an hour later, we were out and on our way to get some celebratory Taco\nBell.\nSunday morning, we all gathered at the Split Mountain Motel before piling into the vehicles heading\nback into the Uinta mountains. Our plan was to navigate to the black stream and push as far as we\ncould. The unfinished, minimal detailed map leads me to believe there is a lot more virgin cave to be\nfound as there is a question mark at the end of what appears to be giant borehole passage. It looks as if\nthe last people there just turned around and never came back to push further, and that got me really\nintrigued. It was about three hours of travel through the cave to make it to the black stream cutoff,\nwhich is just an overflow hall for when the black stream floods and pours into the main cave stream\nknown as the white stream. We waded into the water and started heading up stream to where we last\nsaw the mud bank in November. The stream goes underneath the mudbank where it becomes\nimpassible with choked rocks and breakdown, so the only way on is over. With the support of five\npeople, I was able to stem and climb my way up to the top and anchor a handline for the group. It was\nthe first time any of us had been to this point in the cave, and the giant, gaping borehole with the sound\nof rushing water only added to our excitement. Eric and Justin, with an early callout time for them,\nopted to turn around at this point. Afterall, it’s a part of the cave that not many get to see, and making it\n\nthis far had satisfied their need for underground time. After saying our goodbyes, Andy, Hannah and I\ncontinued on up stream. We traveled upstream for a while longer, encountering waist deep pools which\ndrenched us and filled our boots, eventually coming to what I had heard might be there but hadn’t been\nconfirmed – a full-on swim through snow melt water that went on for an unknown length as it snuck out\nof sight around a corner. Since none of us had packed our wetsuits, this was the end for us. A wet travel\nback through an already cold cave with frozen water near the entrance and snow outside didn’t sound\nas enticing as you might think. Another day we will bring even more gear into the cave to go further. We\nopted to turn around, and once back at the black stream cutoff decided to see what was in store for us\ndown stream. The map had the end of this being marked as sumped (to my understanding never having\nbeen dove for any of you cave divers out there), with many question marks identifying side leads along\nthe way. Hannah and I had only traveled just a small way downstream during our last trip here, so these\npassages were again new to the three of us. We followed the twisting, turning stream passage wading\ninto more waist deep pools, negotiating over breakdown, and down incredible waterfalls all while\ndramatic, high walls (often with gaping holes in the side. Remember those question marks on the map?)\noften leading high and out of site into darkness showed us the way. To our surprise, and joy I might add,\nthis went on for much longer than any of us had really expected. Very often, cave maps simply don’t do\nmuch for showing the massive scale or length of the cave as we experience it in person. Soon enough,\nthe ceiling dropped as though to meet the water but left a ongoing two feet of air space with the floor\nalso dropping and turning it into another swimmer. This is it, the end of the map going downstream,\nwhere it is marked as “sump.” Shining our lights into the low air space, it seemed as though the cave\ngoes on to where no person has been before. I anticipate that it does. Hannah, feeling braver than us,\nstarted to wade into the deep water just to “test the waters.” Soon, the tall sandy banks beneath the\nwater and beneath her feet gave way, sending her into the cold, snowmelt water a lot faster than she\nhad planned. Feeling like this too would need a wet suit and future caving trip, we retreated up stream\nuntil we again met the black stream cutoff. As this was the only flowing water in the cave that we\nencountered today, we drank as much as we could, filled our bottles, had a snack, and started the long\njourney out. We returned to what is known as the Cascade Room and braced ourselves (or maybe it was\njust me) for the long crawl ahead. Round trip, Andy estimated for the day that we had crawled hands\nand knees over rocks and cobble for just under 3,000ft. This is by far my least favorite part of the cave,\nand I’ve done it so, so many times now. After stemming over frozen plunge pools and crawling through\nmazes of log jams, we finally emerged from the cave with just the last sliver of daylight. Wanting to take\nadvantage of the light, we changed into our dry, warm clothes and started the snowshoe back to the\ncars, where we had parked more carefully this time. During the drive back to town, we hypothesized and\nthrew ideas around of where this passage goes or what that lead does or where these passages might\nconnect when really only future trips will help us answer those questions.",
